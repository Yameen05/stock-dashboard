```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd stock-dashboard
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

## Deployment

### Vercel
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Deploy automatically

### Netlify
1. Run `npm run build`
2. Drag and drop the `build` folder to Netlify
3. Or connect your GitHub repository for automatic deployments

### GitHub Pages
1. Install gh-pages: `npm install --save-dev gh-pages`
2. Add deploy script to package.json: `"deploy": "gh-pages -d build"`
3. Run: `npm run deploy`

## API Integration

Currently uses mock data for demonstration. To integrate with a real API:

1. Get an API key from Alpha Vantage, Finnhub, or similar service
2. Update the `stockService.ts` file with your API endpoint and key
3. Uncomment the real API implementation
